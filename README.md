## About the application.

The Web application acts as input to create a [digital profile ID](https://github.com/NAGERI/UG-Profile-ID), whereby a user can have all their Identity cards in one.
The User can also upload documents on the app to act as proof, ( of which are uploaded on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and the hash kept on blockchain).

### NOTE: This is not the final version.
